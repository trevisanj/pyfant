    PFANT Launcher -- Graphical Interface for Spectral Synthesis
    
    Single and multi modes.
    
    Multi mode
    ----------
    
    Runs pfant for different abundances for each element, then run nulbad for each
    pfant result for different FWHMs.
    
    The configuration is read from a .py file.
    
    The user must specify a list of FWHM values for nulbad convolutions, and
    a dictionary containing element symbols and respective list containing n_abdif
    differential abundances to be used for each element.
    
    pfant will be run n_abdif times, each time adding to each element in ab the i-th
    value in the vector for the corresponding element.
    
    nulbad will run n_abdif*n_fwhms times, where n_fwhms is the number of different
    FWHMs specified.
    
    The result will be
    - several spectra saved as  "<star name><pfant name or counter>.sp"
    - several "spectra list" files saved as "cv_<FWHM>.spl". As the file indicates,
      each ".spl" file will have the names of the spectrum files for a specific FWHM.
      .spl files are subject to input for lineplot.py by E.Cantelli
