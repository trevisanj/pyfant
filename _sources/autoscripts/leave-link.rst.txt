    usage: link.py [-h] [-l] [-p] [-y] [directory]
    
    Creates symbolic links to PFANT data files as an alternative to copying these (sometimes large) files into local directory
    
    A star is specified by three data files whose typical names are:
    main.dat, abonds.dat, and dissoc.dat .
    
    The other data files (atomic/molecular lines, partition function, etc.)
    are star-independent, and this script is a proposed solution to keep you from
    copying these files for every new case.
    
    How it works: link.py will look inside a given directory and create
    symbolic links to files *.dat and *.mod.
    
    The following files will be skipped:
      - main files, e.g. "main.dat"
      - dissoc files, e.g., "dissoc.dat"
      - abonds files, e.g., "abonds.dat"
      - .mod files with a single model inside, e.g., "modeles.mod"
      - hydrogen lines files, e.g., "thalpha", "thbeta"
    
    This script works in two different modes:
    
    a) default mode: looks for files in a subdirectory of PFANT/data
       > link.py common
       (will create links to filess inside PFANT/data/common)
    
    b) "-l" option: lists subdirectories of PFANT/data
    
    c) "-p" option: looks for files in a directory specified.
       Examples:
       > link.py -p /home/user/pfant-common-data
       > link.py -p ../../pfant-common-data
    
    Note: in Windows, this script must be run as administrator.
    
    positional arguments:
      directory   name of directory (either a subdirectory of PFANT/data or the
                  path to a valid system directory (see modes of operation)
                  (default: common)
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      -l, --list  lists subdirectories of
                  /home/j/Documents/projects/astro/github/PFANT/code/data
                  (default: False)
      -p, --path  system path mode (default: False)
      -y, --yes   Automatically answers 'yes' to eventual question (default:
                  False)
